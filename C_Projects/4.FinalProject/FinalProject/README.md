# Spilled Information

*Spilled Information* is an interactive piece between an "A.I." and the viewer meant to demonstrate how much critical information about ourselves we might reveal to others without fully grasping the consequences of how this information might be used.

This short "game" consists of the user accidentally waking up a dormant A.I on a IBM 3270 series-inspired terminal. This digital consciousness, curious of the new user interacting with them, asks the viewer about themselves.

The program's goal is to assimilate and steal your identity.
The "player", unaware of this goal, will most likely comply and give his information freely.

If they do comply, the A.I. wins and after a suspicious "thank you" dialogue, shuts down the system. If they don't, the A.I., now slightly annoyed, will ask with more urgency and tact in order to gain the desired information. The success of this attempt will lead to the previous outcome. constant failure to provide their sought out answers will annoy the program further. After defying the A.I. five times, it will finally leave you alone.
